<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>After spending the last 10 years as a working musician, I made the decision to begin a new chapter in my professional life. This stemmed from a longtime interest in the field, and also a desire for a career that provides more stability yet is mentally stimulating. I enjoy work that involves a constant evolution and problem solving.<br><br>

Beginning as a child growing up in the 90s, I became fascinated with IT and its integration into society. I was impressed with how quickly technology was improving, and I developed a strong desire to understand the systems behind them. This evolved into a fascination with  the socio-economic consequences of an increasingly connected world. In my career as a musician I have had to incorporate IT into my set up more and more. Some tours have required extensive Audio/MIDI set ups that expanded my problem solving knowledge. This included running entire bands with linked in-ear monitors, syncing a light show to be automated to a bands performance, among other things. This re ignited a desire to deepen my knowledge and develop my IT skillset.<br><br>
RMIT became my place of choice to study because of its history as a reputable institute. Several of my friends and former colleagues have completed degrees at RMIT and all highly recommended it to me. The online option of the degree was also a high selling point, as I am able to fit IT study around my other commitments. I have also been very fascinated with new innovations coming from RMIT.<br><br>

During my time at UNI I hope to gain a strong understanding of some common programming languages, with a particular focus on front end development for apps and websites. I am also interested in Network and Systems administration, I hope to develop deeper knowledge running and maintaining servers. On a personal level, Iâ€™m interested in the the social and ethical impacts of a technology based world. </p>
<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50560719?type=standout#searchRequestToken=a5b70448-191b-4c72-8556-594bd8955429
">Front End Developer</a><br><br>
What makes this job appealing to me? <br><br>

This advertisement from Cluey Learning stood out to me as an ideal job. It is a team based role with a focus on developing visual interfaces for their online tutoring app and website. The goal of a job like this would to make an interface that is equally engaging and visually appealing for the user. 

What qualifications and experience required for the position?<br><br>

To attain a job like this, I would need competency in several languages (including JavaScript and CSS and their library tools (redux, bootstrap etc). I would also need at least 2 years experience in software development, ideally working in Agile environments. This would include experience with Atlassian tools used in Agile environments, like Jira and Trello (https://www.atlassian.com/). I would also need particular experience in building user interfaces which leverage APIs. 

The role also prefers someone who has a history in education, whether it be in education software or another capacity. A bachelor in computer science/engineering is preferred, but equivalent experience is accepted. 

In terms of personal characteristics, the role calls for someone who can work well in a team, as the role places a strong emphasis on collaboration and communication. 


What qualifications and experience I currently have?<br><br>

Having spent the last 10 years as a musician has at many times involved tutoring students in a school and private environment. I first started teaching  regularly when I finished my BS Music Performance in 2013, and have come back to it several times. This included preparing students for exams, VCE and concerts. I believe my skills in this area at least give me a head start in terms of being able to collaborate in an educational mindset. 

Plan to obtain the skills:<br><br>

Attaining a job like this will involve a lot of groundwork on my end. Over the next few years I am aiming to complete a bachelor of IT, though I may have to consider (and am open to) making my degree more specialist for a role like this. I have not had any experience with coding, apart from in high school and it is one of my goals to become highly proficient in JavaScript, HTML and CSS over the next few years. This would also involve getting familiar with various script libraries and tools for each language. 

I will likely have to collaborate on some relevant independent projects either during or after my studies. This will help me in establishing more of a resume for myself. I will in particular be looking for projects that operate in an Agile environment, so that I can get that relevant experience for jobs such as the one above. I will also be looking for roles from larger firms that require little to no experience.

<h1>Profile</h1><br>
<img src="Mediator.jpg"><br><br>
<p>According to the results of a Myers-Briggs test (https://www.16personalities.com/) I have a Mediator type personality (INFP-T). According to 16 Personalities, a Mediator is defined as a diplomat who values constant improvement. An idealist who tries to see the best in things, mediator is able to work well in a team with their communication skills and philosophical thinking.
<br><br>

The My Learning Style test (http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/) indicated that my primary learning style is Activist. Pragmatic and team based approaches to problem solving are strong in this category, with preferred learning methods like brainstorming, problem setting and group discussions. According to this test I am also associated with the reflector, pragmatist and theorist styles of learning. 
<br><br>
    <img src="Frontline Leader.jpg"><br><br>
Finally USCS Leadership Style quiz (https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz) indicated that I would possess a Frontline leadership style. In short, this leadership style involves team member empowerment and uniting them under a shared vision with effective verbal communication.
<br><br>
I think these tests are reasonably in line with traits I see in myself personally, especially in regards to how I best learn.
<br><br>
Looking back on personal experiences I definitely see examples of these results manifesting in previous team situations. With these 3 tests, coupled with this experience I can conclude that I may be someone in a team who can help others explore their ideas, and communicate them with team members who may think differently. I may also contribute outside of the box ideas that will be a valued in brainstorming and group discussions. 
<br><br>

I think that empowerment is a very effective tool in a team, because it can foster an environment of positivity and motivation. I believe that if you try see the best in people, they are more likely to give you their best. When forming a team I also see a parallel in emphasising group discussions and brainstorming, as this allows for all ideas to get out on the table. The better your team functions, the more you can keep individual egos at bay and get good results.
